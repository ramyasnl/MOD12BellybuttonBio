# Plotly & BellyButton Biodiversity</br>
To cater the growing population and to reduce the carbon emission we are in a place to find an alternative to meat. Combining plant based protein and the microorganism which makes us feel the taste of meat we can successfully create a plant based meat alternative.The human body is a source of thousands of bacteria, different types of bacteria live in different parts of the body. Bacteria found in gut are not the same as the bacteria found in eye lashes. We believe that bacterial species tasting like beef is present in someone’s belly button.In search of the beef tasting bacteria we sample the bellybutton bacterial species of people across the country and created an interactive visualization to display the top ten species of them.</br>

## Summary of the Project </br>
#### The Horizontal Bar Chart and Demographics Panel </br>
Using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, we have created a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.And on the Demographics panel the information about the Individual is displayed. 

#### The Bubble Chart</br>
- The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
- The sample_values as the y-axis values.
- The sample_values as the marker size.
- The otu_ids as the marker colors.
- The otu_labels as the hover-text values

####  The Gauge Chart</br>
A gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value is created and it displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
 
 Finally the web page is deployed in GitHub .
