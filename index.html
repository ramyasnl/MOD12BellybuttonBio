          This arguably understudied question is the scientific focus of the research team at Improbable Foods,
           the company Green founded and whose mission is to completely replace animals as a food production technology. 
           Discovering and imitating the molecular interactions that make meat delicious 
           “is the most important scientific question in the world right now,” Green said. 
          This is the story of Rosa a scientist at Improbable Beef mimics the delicious taste 
          of meat by studying and documenting the different microbes.
          <br /><br />Bacterial species are not well studied and many of them remain unknown to science. 
          Labs across the country have success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi and planktons. 
          Rosa’s hypothesis is there should be a microorganism that can supply the next best taste and 
          she believes that they are found in each human body.
          The human body is a source of thousands of bacteria, different types of bacteria live in different parts of the body.
          Bacteria found in gut are not the same as the bacteria found in eye lashes.
          Rosa believes that bacterial species tasting like beef is present in someone’s belly button.<br /><br />
          To test the hypothesis, we have sampled the belly button bacterial species of people across the country. 
          Each person is given an id number to protect their identity. 
          Our dashboard represents the different bacterial species and their occurrence in all the test subjects.
          We did a visualization which helps to understand the data better.
